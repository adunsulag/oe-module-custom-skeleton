# 2.0.0

Renamed the CustomSkeletonAPI to be CustomSkeletonRestController which is a breaking change.
Added examples of handling and creating custom FHIR resources to deal with a custom FHIR endpoint.
Added support for the API showing up in the FHIR metadata endpoint and hooking into the service
override for FHIR.
Put in an example of adding to the FHIR scopes which is actually required in order to use the
resource.
